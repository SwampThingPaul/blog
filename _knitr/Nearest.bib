	abstract = {The spatial and temporal dimensions of ecological phenomena have always been inherent in the conceptual framework of ecology, but only recently have they been incorporated explicitly into ecological theory, sampling design, experimental design and models. Statistical techniques for spatial analysis of ecological data are burgeoning and many ecologists are unfamiliar with what is available and how the techniques should be used correctly. This book gives an overview of the wide range of spatial statistics available to analyse ecological data, and provides advice and guidance for graduate students and practising researchers who are either about to embark on spatial analysis in ecological studies or who have started but are unsure how to proceed. Only a basic understanding of statistics is assumed and many schematic illustrations are given to complement or replace mathematical technicalities, making the book accessible to ecologists wishing to enter this important and fast-growing field for the first time.},

	abstract = {The main object of the paper is to give a general review of the nature and importance of significance tests. Such tests are regarded as procedures for measuring the consistency of data with a null hypothesis by the calculation of a p-value (tail area). A distinction is drawn between several kinds of null hypothesis. The ways of deriving tests, namely via the so-called absolute test, via implicit consideration of alternatives and via explicit consideration of alternatives are reviewed. Some of the difficulties of multidimensional alternatives are outlined and the importance of the diagnostic ability of a test is stressed. Brief examples include tests of distributional form including multivariate normality. The effect of modifying statistical analysis in the light of the data is discussed, four main cases being distinguished. Then a number of more technical aspects of significance tests are outlined, including the role of two-sided tests, the role of the continuity correction, Bayesian tests and the use of tests in the comparison of alternative models. Finally the circumstances are reviewed under which significance tests can provide the main summary of a statistical analysis.},

	abstract = {Spatial point processes may be analysed at two levels. Quadrat and distance methods were designed for the sampling of a population in the field. In this paper we consider those situations in which a map of a spatial pattern has been produced at some cost and we wish to extract the maximum possible information. We review the stochastic models which have been proposed for spatial point patterns and discuss methods by which the fit of such a model can be tested. Certain models are shown to be the equilibrium distributions of spatial–temporal stochastic processes. The theory is illustrated by several case studies.},
