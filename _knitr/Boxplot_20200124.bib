	abstract = {In this paper we suggest a simple way of constructing a bivariate boxplot based on convex hull peeling and B-spline smoothing. The proposed method shows some advantages with respect to that suggested by Goldberg and Iglewicz (1992). Our approach leads to defining a natural inner region which is completely nonparametric and smooth. Furthermore it retains the correlation in the observations and adapts to differing spread of the data in the different directions. The outer contour, which is based on a multiple of the distance of the inner region from the centre, is robust to the presence of clusters of outliers. We also show how the construction of a bivariate boxplot for each pair of variables can become a very useful tool for the detection of multivariate outliers. @ 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

	abstract = {This introduction to the R package beanplot is a (slightly) modiﬁed version of Kampstra (2008), published in the Journal of Statistical Software. Boxplots and variants thereof are frequently used to compare univariate data. Boxplots have the disadvantage that they are not easy to explain to non-mathematicians, and that some information is not visible. A beanplot is an alternative to the boxplot for visual comparison of univariate data between groups. In a beanplot, the individual observations are shown as small lines in a one-dimensional scatter plot. Next to that, the estimated density of the distributions is visible and the average is shown. It is easy to compare diﬀerent groups of data in a beanplot and to see if a group contains enough observations to make the group interesting from a statistical point of view. Anomalies in the data, such as bimodal distributions and duplicate measurements, are easily spotted in a beanplot. For groups with two subgroups (e.g., male and female), there is a special asymmetric beanplot. For easy usage, an implementation was made in R.},
